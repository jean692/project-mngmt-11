## Project Overview:
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and project management materials for Project Team 11's **Text Adventure Creation Tool**. The project aims to develop a web-based tool that allows users with little or no programming experience to create interactive text-based adventure games. The tool will support branching narratives, media uploads, and accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for persons with disabilities.

## Sprint 1 Goal:
The main objective of **Sprint 1** is to design the user interfaces for key features such as:
- Creating new projects (R1)
- Adding and editing rooms (R2)
- Creating branching narratives (R3)
- Saving and loading projects (R8)
- Previewing games (R6)

No functional development was done in Sprint 1, but the visual designs, ERDs, and class diagrams were completed.

## Sprint 2 and 3 Goals:
- **Sprint 2**: Develop and test media uploads, accessibility options, and game preview functionality.
- **Sprint 3**: Focus on game export, project collaboration, and the integration of tutorials.
